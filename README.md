# AC-NA-Feature-Contribution-Analysis

This repository contains the complete code and data used in my masterâ€™s thesis:

> **"The Contribution of Subjective Experiences in Video Games to Playersâ€™ Well-Being: A Case Study of Animal Crossing: New Horizons"**

ðŸ“Œ This repository link is referenced in the thesis to ensure transparency, replicability, and academic integrity.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The research investigates:
- How well subjective experience features predict playersâ€™ well-being
- Which machine learning model performs best
- How feature importance varies, using SHAP analysis
- Whether gender and age moderate the relationship using Hierarchical Linear Modeling

---

## ðŸ“‚ Data

- `RawData.csv` contains the cleaned and anonymized dataset used for modeling.
- It includes gameplay data and survey responses collected from players of *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*.
- Due to privacy and scope, only derived features and de-identified data are included.
